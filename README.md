# SnakeGame (Introduction)
This is our WIF3005 Software Maintenance Assignment.
We are required to apply adaptive maintenance by changing the original code in C(SnakeGameWithFullCommentInC.c) into Java(GameController.java).

## Configuration
In order to run in the console mode:
1. Redirect to the directory that containe GameController.java file
2. Compile the java file by using this command line
	* javac GameController.java
3. Run the GameController with this command line
	* java GameController

<i>Note: If you wish to run in netbean please uncomment the package name. In order to run in console, the java file shouldn't have a package name before you compile.</i>

## Important Note:
1. Remember to make sure the JFrame is place infront your console when you try to start and play the game. Because the JFrame is a keyListener.

2. When game over, you should make sure the keyListener JFrame is place at the back of the console because you need to key in your Name as word not a keypress.
